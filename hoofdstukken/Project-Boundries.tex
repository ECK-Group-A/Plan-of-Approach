\chapter{Project Boundries and Limits}

A single device for synchronizing the camera and the LIDAR will be constructed throughout this project. On-site installation and testing of this controller will occur at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. This controller conforms with the client-approved program of criteria. 

\justify
Only the controller which has been created is supplied. A brief verbal instruction and demonstration will follow the delivery. Apart from the final report, no more documentation, technical drawings, or safety instructions will be provided. 

\justify
Besides the aforementioned spoken instruction on delivery and final report, the project team will offer no more training or teaching. Any further maintenance or addition of functionality is beyond this project's scope.
