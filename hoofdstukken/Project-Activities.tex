\chapter{Project Activities}
This chapter will contain all the activities that will need to take place in order to deliver all the project results in chapter \ref{ch:results}. And all the activities required in order to receive a passing grade. All the activities relating to the organisation of the project will instead be discussed in chapter \ref{ch:organisation}.

\section{Plan of approach}
The plan of approach will serve as reference for the remainder of the project, both technical and organisational.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Setting up the document
    \item Drafting the PoA
    \item Discuss PoA with client and coach
    \item Write the definitive PoA
\end{itemize}

\section{Midterm presentation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Figure out presentation narrative
    \item Make \& Practice presentation
    \item Present.
\end{itemize}

\section{Orientation and Research}
A period of orientation and extensive research is required before starting development on a complex project. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Research and understand the problem
    \item Determine the technical requirements with client
    \item Deepen understanding on respective technical topics
    \item Potentially pre order components
\end{itemize}

\section{Development prototype}
Most of the time will probably be spent on the development of the prototype. The specific part names are intentionally vague because they should follow from the system architecture.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Set up development environment
    \item Create system architecture
    \item Agile development loop
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Plan unit development
        \item Design unit
        \item Test unit
        \item Evaluate unit
    \end{itemize}
    \item System integration
    \item Prototype testing
    \item Design PCB
    \item Purchase parts
    \item Solder PCB
    \item Adapt prototype software to PCB
    \item Test PCB
\end{itemize}

\section{Technical documentation \& report}
\begin{itemize}        
    \item Setting up the document
    \item Draft chapter layout
    \item Write the technical documentation
    \item Discuss the documentation with client and coach
    \item Write the definitive documentation
\end{itemize}

\section{Paper}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Setting up the document (IEEE)
    \item Draft chapters layout and research narrative
    \item Discuss paper with coach
    \item Write the definitive paper
\end{itemize}

\section{Poster presentation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Figure out presentation narrative
    \item Make \& Practice presentation
    \item Design \& print poster
    \item Prepare prototype for demonstration
    \item Present
\end{itemize}
