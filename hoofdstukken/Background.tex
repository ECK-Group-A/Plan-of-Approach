\chapter{Background}

The Smart Sensors Systems (S3) research-group is developing a sensor suite capable of detection and classification for robotics applications in collaboration with industry and academic partners. Sensors such as LiDAR and cameras are required for these robotics applications.

\section{Problem definition}

Smart Sensors Systems is working on a sensor suite, using LIDAR and camera's to
detect and classify objects. For various reasons, it is important that the
frames of the LIDAR and camera are captured at the same time. We are tasked
with designing electronics that can capture the frames at the same time. And
timestamp them accordingly.
